description: This is a point-and-click game that is meant to teach the benefits of using a password manager. The main character Sherclock and his trusty aide Watson travel through time to protect their client's cyber presence. It incorporates transformational game design and self-efficacy principles.
summary: This game is made with Unity 2D and C#. I worked as a member of the Carnegie Mellon University CyLab on this project in Fall 2018.
