description: This is a VR dancing game similar to Beat Saber. The player is situated in a world under their bed, and the evil Boogieman is performing dance moves that create blocks. The player needs to hit these blocks in time with the beat of "Stayin' Alive" by the Bee Gees in order to thwart the Boogieman, which in turn makes them perform the dance move in real life with the VR controller.
summary: This is a video game made with Unity 3D, Steam VR, and C#. This game was created for the Research Issues in Game Development - AR/VR course at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2019.
team: <ul><li>Kalpa A</li><li>Nathan (Carter) Williams</li><li>Lisa Lo</li><li>Connie Chau</li><li>Ann Maria</li><li>Sebastian Yang</li></ul>
involvement: I pitched the initial idea, and I was the team lead, a game designer, and lead programmer for the team.
