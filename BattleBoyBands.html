description: Battle of the Boy Bands is a game of witty insults and fire raps. You play as a boy band rapper from a not-so-well-known boy band participating in the underground rap scene. Rap battle other boy band rappers by choosing the best responses to their insults, and gain clout for your band as you impress the audience. But be careful â€” the more rappers you defeat, the harder it becomes to choose a response. Defeat all the other rappers and help your boy band rise to fame as number one!
summary: This is a video game made with Unity 2D and C#. I pitched and worked with CMU Game Creation Society in Fall 2020 on this game. This won the GCS Gold Award.
