description: This is a game about the industrial revolution, and in particular a steel strike at Andrew Carnegie's factory. It incorporates transformational game design principles in order to teach the players about history in an interesting way.
summary: This is a video game made with Unity 2D and C#. I did independent research with Dr. Erik Harpstead on this project, intending to use it as a way of gauging how much players are able to learn about the industrial revolution after playing the game.
team: I worked alone.
involvement: I was involved in the design, development, creation of testing protocol, and execution of testing.
